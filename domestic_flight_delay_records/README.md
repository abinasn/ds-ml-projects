This document outlines the PySpark tasks to be performed on the **Domestic Flight Delay Records** dataset. The dataset includes information on flight dates, airtime, flight distance, scheduled departure and arrival times, and delays.

---

## Task 1: Early Arrivals

Create a function that returns the **number of flights that arrived earlier than expected** (i.e., arrival_delay < 0).

---

## Task 2: Typical Departure Time for Long Flights

Create a function that determines the **typical (most common) departure time** for flights **over 2000 miles**.

---

## Task 3: Long Arrival Delays

Create a function that returns the **proportion of flights** with **arrival delays longer than 60 minutes**.

---

## Task 4: Average Airtime Before 9:00 AM

Create a function that returns the **average airtime** for flights that **departed before 9:00 AM**.

---

## Task 5: Max Arrival Delay With No Departure Delay

Create a function that returns the **maximum arrival delay** for flights that did **not experience any departure delay** (i.e., departure_delay == 0).
